This bug is the extension of the apache bug 46215
https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=46215

The type of the worker->s->busy in mod_proxy_balancer.c is size_t. And there are no locks in busy++ and busy--. So, the busy may become very big in some situation.
In order to trigger this bug, I add a sleep(2) function when worker->s ->busy equals to 1.

Steps:

0. Run the mk.sh in command line
./mk.sh

1. Replace the httpd.conf in the ../conf/httpd.conf
mv ./httpd.conf ./apache-install/conf/httpd.conf

2. Revise the path of Directory and DocumentRoot with your own path

3. cd ./apache/bin

4. Srart the apache 
./apachectl start

5. Run the ab using the following command line
./ab -n 1000 -c 1000 -k http://127.0.1.1:8000/test

6. Open the browser and input http://127.0.1.1:8000/test/balancer-manager/

7. See if the busyness of every proxy worker is normal

8. Execute the step 5 many times to get a satisfied result
